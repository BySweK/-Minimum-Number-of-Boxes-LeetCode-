## Minimum Number of Boxes (LeetCode)

This problem helped me understand the greedy approach.

Steps:
1. Calculate total number of apples.
2. Sort box capacities in descending order.
3. Select boxes from largest to smallest until all apples fit.

Key idea:
- This is an accumulation problem, not a comparison problem.
